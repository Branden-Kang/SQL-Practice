--Q5
-- It is better to use rollup instead of acube because Rollup generates n+1 output but cube generates 2^n output and cube relations are often large.
-- When I use a cube in question4, the combination of output is so huge and it is not easy to interpret.
-- Here is my "cube" code below:
--select coinname.coin, year, month, to_char(avg(close), 99999.99) as close
--from coinname, coinprice
--where coinname.coin = coinprice.coin
--group by rollup(coinname.coin), rollup(year), rollup(month);
--Question 6
--Answer: group by rollup(a), rollup(b), rollup(c), rollup(d)
--For example, groupby by rollup(a), rollup(b) is {emptyset,a} * {emptyset,b} = {emptyset, {a}, {b}, {a,b}} = cube {a,b}
--So, the cartesian product of a, b, c, d, emptyset gives all the groupings created by the cube function.
